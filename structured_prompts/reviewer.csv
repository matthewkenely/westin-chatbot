"I'm very sorry to hear about the drainage smell in your room. This is indeed a known issue in that wing, and we are scheduled for renovations next month to address it permanently. In the meantime, we would have been happy to move you to another room. Could I ask why you didn't request a room change?","I actually did mention it to the front desk on the second day, but I was told that the hotel was fully booked and no other rooms were available. I find it frustrating that you're charging over €300 per night for rooms with known issues. If you're aware of a problem this significant, those rooms should either be discounted or not rented until fixed. The smell made it unpleasant to spend time in the room, which is a basic expectation when paying premium rates. I appreciate that renovations are planned, but that doesn't help those of us who stayed before those repairs."
"I apologize for the noisy air conditioning unit in your room. Our maintenance team regularly services these units, but some of our older models can become noisy over time. We could have offered you a different room or had a technician inspect the unit. Was this reported during your stay?","Yes, I reported it on the first night, and someone did come to look at it. They said it was ""working normally"" and that the noise was ""just how these units sound."" I couldn't sleep properly for three nights because of the constant rattling and humming. For a supposedly luxury hotel, I expected either silent air conditioning or at least a quick solution when problems arise. The technician seemed to dismiss my concern rather than trying to resolve it, which made the situation even more frustrating."
"We're sorry you had trouble with temperature control in your room. This is unusual as all our rooms should have individually adjustable thermostats. Our engineering team would have been able to address this issue promptly had it been reported.","I did report it twice, actually. The first time, someone came and told me the system was set to ""winter mode"" throughout the hotel, meaning all rooms could only receive heating, not cooling - despite it being 25°C outside. The second time, I was told nothing could be done about it. We ended up sleeping with the balcony door open and using the small desk fan, which isn't what I expect when paying for a luxury hotel. It seems unreasonable that a modern hotel doesn't have systems that can provide both heating and cooling based on actual weather conditions rather than arbitrary seasonal settings."
"We apologize for the noise disturbance from our children's playground. We try to balance family-friendly facilities with peaceful accommodations. In the future, please let us know your preference for a quieter location, and we'll do our best to accommodate you away from high-activity areas.","The issue isn't that you have a playground - I understand it's a family resort. The problem is that I specifically requested a quiet room when booking three months in advance. When I checked in and realized the location, I immediately asked about changing rooms but was told nothing else was available. There should be better planning about room assignments, especially for guests who specifically request quiet accommodations. At minimum, your booking system should flag rooms near noise sources so guests can make informed choices, rather than discovering it after unpacking."
"I'm sorry to hear that our suite didn't meet your expectations. Our website does show images and descriptions of all room types. The Executive Suites do feature a semi-open plan design rather than completely separate rooms, which many guests prefer for the spacious feeling.","The issue isn't about preference - it's about accurate description. Calling it a ""suite"" implies separate rooms, not just a partially removed wall with no door between the bed and the living area. This meant when our child went to sleep, we had to sit in near darkness and whisper. The photos on your website are taken with wide-angle lenses that don't make this layout clear. I've stayed in genuine suites at other Marriott properties, and this absolutely would not qualify. It feels deliberately misleading, especially given the significant price premium for these rooms."
"Please accept our apologies for the inconsistent housekeeping service. This falls short of our standards, and I've shared your feedback with our Executive Housekeeper to address with the team. May I ask if you reported these issues during your stay?","Yes, I reported it after the third day when it became a pattern rather than a one-off oversight. The front desk apologized and said they would notify housekeeping, but it didn't improve consistently. Some days the room would be perfectly clean, other days it seemed like they just made the bed and left. Towels were sometimes replaced when we'd hung them up (following your environmental cards), while actual garbage wasn't emptied. There seemed to be no system or standard being followed. For a hotel of this caliber, I expected thorough, consistent cleaning services every day without having to repeatedly request it."
"Thank you for your feedback about our room decor. While our rooms are comfortable and well-maintained, we understand some guests prefer more modern styling. We're actually planning updates to our room decor in phases over the next 18 months.","It's not just about styling preferences - there were actual signs of wear and tear that affected functionality. The desk chair was worn and uncomfortable, the carpet had visible stains, and the bathroom fixtures showed significant tarnishing. Comfort is subjective, but these are objective quality issues. I've stayed at other hotels in the same price range that maintain their facilities much better. I'm glad to hear renovations are planned, but I think more frequent maintenance and replacement of worn items shouldn't wait for a complete renovation cycle."
"I'm deeply sorry about your experience with room cleaning. This is completely unacceptable and falls far below our standards. I'll be addressing this urgently with our housekeeping management. To better understand the situation, could you tell me which days these lapses occurred?","It happened throughout our week-long stay, but was particularly bad on Tuesday and Thursday. On Tuesday, we returned to find breakfast room service trays still in the room from morning, trash cans overflowing, and used towels just piled on the bathroom floor rather than replaced. On Thursday, the bed was made but with the same visibly stained sheets from the night before when my child spilled juice. The mini-bar wasn't restocked once during our entire stay despite items being consumed and listed on the form. What bothered me most wasn't just the oversight but having to call multiple times for basic cleaning services that should be automatic in a luxury hotel."
"Please accept our sincere apologies regarding the delay with your baby cot. We aim to have all special requests ready before arrival, especially for our youngest guests. There seems to have been a miscommunication between departments, which is not acceptable. We're reviewing our procedures to prevent this from happening again.","The issue wasn't just the delay, but the stress it caused after a long journey with a tired infant. We arrived at 3pm, well after check-in time, and had notified you about the cot requirement when booking three months earlier, and again during online check-in. When we arrived, we were told it would be ""right up."" After 30 minutes of trying to keep an overtired baby entertained, we called again and were told it was ""on the way."" Another 30 minutes passed before it finally arrived. The lack of urgency for something so essential for a baby's comfort, despite multiple advance notifications, showed a concerning disconnect in your guest service priorities."
"I apologize for the delays you experienced with room service. We strive to deliver orders within 30-40 minutes, and it's disappointing to hear we fell short. Would you be willing to share which meal period this occurred during? We sometimes experience higher volume during peak hours.","This happened twice, and neither was during what you would consider peak hours. The first was a Tuesday at 2:30pm when we ordered a simple sandwich and salad - it took over an hour to arrive. The second was Thursday around 9:30pm when we ordered desserts, which took 75 minutes, and arrived cold. Both times we called to check on our order after 45 minutes and were told it was ""being prepared"" or ""just leaving the kitchen."" What made it more frustrating was seeing room service deliveries to other rooms while we were still waiting. And there was no apology or acknowledgment of the delay when the food finally arrived."
"I'm very sorry your check-in experience wasn't welcoming. As a Gold member, you deserve recognition and excellent service from the moment you arrive. Would you be willing to share more details about your experience so we can address this with our front desk team?","We arrived around 2pm, and I mentioned my Gold status when I provided my ID. The staff member barely acknowledged it and made no mention of my benefits or potential room upgrades. When I specifically asked about an upgrade, she seemed annoyed and said nothing was available without checking the system. I then asked when our room would be ready (since check-in is at 3pm, I understood we might need to wait), and she curtly said ""when housekeeping is done"" without offering any time estimate or apologizing for the wait. No offer of welcome drinks, no suggestion to use facilities while waiting, nothing to make us feel valued after a long journey. The contrast with check-in experiences at other Marriott properties was stark and disappointing."
"Thank you for your feedback about our main swimming pool. While our pool is one of the largest in Malta, we understand some guests may prefer more features. We do have the Reef Club with additional pools that offer different experiences. Did you have a chance to visit those during your stay?","Yes, we did visit the Reef Club pools, which were somewhat better but still basic compared to other 5-star resorts we've visited. My point is that for a family-oriented resort, the main pool is surprisingly plain - just a large rectangle of water. Children quickly become bored without water features to engage them. Even simple additions like fountains or water jets would make a significant difference. Given Malta's beautiful weather and the hotel's coastal location, the pool areas should be showcase features, not just basic amenities. Other resorts in this price range invest more creativity into their pool designs to create memorable experiences."
"Regarding your comment about our casino being small, it's true that our gaming area is boutique-sized compared to some major gambling destinations. We focus on providing a select gaming experience rather than a large-scale casino operation. Malta has several larger casinos if that's what you're looking for during your next visit.","I understand it's not meant to be a major casino, but my issue is with the marketing. Your website prominently features the casino as an attraction and amenity, with photos taken from angles that make it appear much larger. It created an expectation that wasn't met. When we visited, we found just a handful of slot machines and two table games in what felt like a converted meeting room. I'm not expecting Las Vegas, but the reality was so different from how it was presented that it felt misleading. If it's a small amenity, it should be described as such rather than highlighted as a major feature of the resort."
"We sincerely apologize for the lift service disruptions during your stay. We experienced a technical issue that affected some of our elevators, which has since been resolved. We understand how inconvenient this must have been, especially considering our multi-story layout.","This wasn't just a one-time technical issue - the elevators were problematic throughout our entire week-long stay. Two of the four elevators were completely out of service for days, and the remaining two would often skip floors or take extremely long to arrive. We frequently waited 5-10 minutes for an elevator, which then arrived completely full. This was particularly difficult when returning with our young children tired from swimming, or when we were running late for dinner reservations. There were no signs explaining the situation or apologizing for the inconvenience, and when I asked at reception, they just said ""maintenance is working on it"" without any timeline or alternative suggestions."
"We appreciate your feedback about the Executive Lounge happy hour selection. We rotate our offerings regularly and try to balance variety with quality. We'll certainly take your suggestions into consideration as we review our lounge offerings. Could you specify what additional options you would have preferred?","The issue wasn't so much about specific drinks I wanted but the overall limited selection compared to Executive Lounges at other Marriott properties. There was only one red wine, one white wine, and two beer options, with no spirits available. The wines were also very basic local varieties rather than anything premium. Other Westin Executive Lounges I've visited offer at least 3-4 wine choices, basic spirits, and premium beers. Given that lounge access is either an expensive add-on or a benefit for loyal customers, the offering felt skimpy and calculated to minimize costs rather than impress guests who are often your most frequent customers."
"I apologize for your experience with our whirlpool temperature. Our facilities team regulates the temperature according to health and safety standards. If you ever encounter issues like this again during your stay, please inform our staff immediately so we can check if there's a technical problem.","I did report it to both the pool attendant and the front desk on our second day. The pool attendant simply shrugged and said ""it's always like that,"" while the front desk said they would ""look into it"" but nothing changed throughout our stay. A whirlpool that's colder than room temperature with minimal jet action is effectively just a small, cold pool - it defeats the entire purpose of having a whirlpool. Either there's a persistent technical issue that's being ignored, or the hotel has deliberately set it this way to save on heating costs. Either explanation reflects poorly on a luxury resort experience, especially when the whirlpool is advertised as a premium relaxation feature."
"I'm very sorry about your unsatisfactory spa experience. Our therapists are trained to professional standards, though styles may vary. I'd like to learn more about your specific concerns with the massage technique and table comfort so we can address these issues directly with our spa management.","The massage therapist seemed untrained in basic techniques - there was no flow to the massage, pressure was inconsistent and sometimes painful, and when I requested focus on my shoulder tension, she briefly worked on it then moved on to following a generic routine. Regarding the table, it was hard and flat with no face cradle adjustment, making it uncomfortable to breathe properly when face-down. The cold jacuzzi was another disappointment - what should have been a relaxing warm soak was instead a chilly pool that no one was using. For spa treatments priced at premium rates (€110 for a basic 50-minute massage), I expect properly trained therapists and professional-grade equipment. This felt like an amateur setup charging luxury prices."
"I understand your frustration regarding our Executive Lounge policy during evening hours. This policy aims to maintain a quieter atmosphere for guests conducting business or seeking relaxation. We do welcome children during other hours, and we offer family-friendly alternatives like our kids' club during evening hours.","What's frustrating is the lack of transparency about this policy. We specifically purchased lounge access as a family benefit, and this restriction wasn't mentioned during purchase, nor is it clearly stated on your website. We only discovered it when we were turned away at the door at 6pm with our well-behaved 8-year-old. This meant our family was split up during what should have been relaxing pre-dinner time together, or we all had to forgo the lounge access we had paid for. If this is your policy, it needs to be clearly disclosed before purchase. Other Marriott properties with similar policies either have family sections in their lounges or are very explicit about age restrictions at the time of booking."
"Thank you for your feedback about the in-room coffee options. We currently offer tea kettles with instant coffee as our standard amenity. We do have proper coffee available through room service and in all our restaurants and cafes. We'll consider your suggestion for in-room coffee machines for future upgrades.","Instant coffee is below the standard of what's offered in other hotels at this price point. Most 4 and 5-star hotels now offer Nespresso machines or similar pod-based systems in their rooms, especially in their higher category rooms. Having to order room service (with its associated charge and wait time) for a decent cup of coffee first thing in the morning is inconvenient and feels like nickel-and-diming guests who are already paying premium rates. This is a small amenity that makes a big difference to the daily guest experience, and it's disappointing to see the Westin cutting corners here when your competitors are providing better in-room refreshment options."
"I apologize that our gluten-free breakfast options didn't meet your expectations. We do try to cater to various dietary needs and have gluten-free items available upon request. We'll share your feedback with our culinary team to improve our offerings. Was there something specific you were hoping to find?","The issue wasn't just limited options but the poor quality and handling of what was available. The gluten-free bread was served still frozen in the middle, the muffin was dry to the point of crumbling, and cross-contamination was evident with regular bread touching gluten-free items. When I asked about other options like gluten-free cereal, yogurt without added ingredients, or specially prepared eggs, the staff seemed confused and unaware of what contained gluten. For someone with celiac disease or serious gluten intolerance, this isn't just disappointing—it's potentially harmful. Many other hotels now train their staff properly on allergens and offer a dedicated allergy-friendly station to prevent cross-contamination. This should be a standard safety practice, not a special request."
"I'm sorry to hear the Executive Lounge didn't accommodate your dietary needs adequately. While our lounge offers a set menu with limited customization options, we should always try to address dietary restrictions. I'll speak with our lounge management about improving flexibility for special dietary requirements.","When I inquired about protein options without breading or sauce (due to my dietary restrictions), the lounge attendant didn't even offer to check with the kitchen. She simply said, ""What you see is what we have."" I wasn't asking for special preparation, just information about whether there were any plain protein options available or if the sauce could be served on the side. This inflexible attitude was surprising in a premium lounge. At other Executive Lounges I've visited, staff are typically eager to check what simple modifications might be possible. It felt like the staff were trained to deny requests rather than find solutions, which contradicts the enhanced service level expected in an executive offering."
"We apologize for any disappointment regarding our restaurant closures during your stay. We do operate seasonal schedules for some of our dining venues, which is common practice in resort destinations. Our website and pre-arrival communications try to keep guests informed about which restaurants will be operational during their stay.","My frustration isn't about seasonal closures in general, but about the lack of clear communication. When I booked three months in advance, I checked your dining page which showed all restaurants operating. There was no indication that Quadro or Palio's would be closed during our dates. We specifically chose your resort partly because of the dining variety advertised, and finding two of the four main restaurants closed upon arrival was disappointing. If you know certain restaurants operate seasonally, this information should be prominently displayed on your website with specific closure dates, not discovered only after arrival. This significantly reduced our dining options and forced us to eat off-property more than planned, which was an inconvenience we hadn't anticipated."
"Regarding your question about food service at The Reef pool bar, we do have designated hours for food service there, typically until 3:00 PM. After that, our main restaurants and lounge options are available. These hours are set based on typical guest patterns and staffing considerations.","The issue is that these limited hours aren't clearly communicated anywhere. There's no signage at the pool bar showing food service hours, nothing mentioned on your in-room dining guide, and the staff by the pool couldn't explain why hot food couldn't be served at 3pm on a hot afternoon when people are actively using the pool. It seems arbitrary and inconvenient, especially for families with children who often need to eat at non-standard times. With the main restaurants closed between lunch and dinner, and the casual option shutting down early, there was a strange 2-3 hour window where getting food anywhere in the resort was unnecessarily difficult. Other resorts I've stayed at either maintain all-day casual dining options or at least clearly communicate the hours so guests can plan accordingly."
"Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding our menu options for your training diet. While we aim to cater to various preferences, we acknowledge we might not have enough high-protein, low-carb options. We'll share this with our culinary team as they develop future menus. Did you try our customized options or speak with our chef about your specific needs?","I did speak with a server about possible modifications and was told the chef could remove carbs from some dishes but couldn't add extra protein or create something off-menu. Even the salads were predominantly lettuce with minimal protein additions. For a resort of this size and caliber, I expected more flexibility and awareness of different dietary approaches. Many hotels now offer protein-forward options that aren't just for athletic diets but appeal to keto, paleo, and other common eating patterns. This seemed like a significant oversight in your food program. I ended up having to order protein bars online and have them delivered to the hotel, which was an added expense and inconvenience during what was supposed to be a relaxing stay."
"We're sorry to hear you felt our pricing didn't reflect the value received. We strive to deliver a premium experience that justifies our rates. Would you be willing to share specific aspects where you felt the value was lacking? This feedback helps us improve.","The overall issue is the gap between positioning and delivery. When paying over €350 per night (with taxes and fees), certain standards are expected: rooms without maintenance issues, consistent housekeeping, responsive service, and amenities that work properly. Instead, we experienced drainage smells, temperature control problems, erratic cleaning, slow service, and facilities like the whirlpool that weren't functioning as intended. Individual issues might be overlooked, but collectively they created a sense that the resort is trading on its past reputation rather than earning its premium price today. The common areas and grounds are beautiful, but the operational details that actually impact the guest experience seem neglected. I've stayed at hotels charging half as much that delivered more consistent quality and service."
"I apologize for the wait time during check-out. We do experience peak periods, especially around our 11am check-out time. We offer express check-out options via email or TV to avoid queuing. I'll review our staffing during busy periods to reduce wait times. How long did you end up waiting?","We waited nearly 35 minutes to check out, with only two staff members handling a line of about 15 parties. What made it more frustrating was that we had tried the express check-out option through the TV system the night before, but it wasn't working - it kept showing an error message. When I mentioned this during check-out, the staff member simply said, ""Yes, that happens sometimes"" without any apology. There was also no acknowledgment of the long wait or any effort to speed up the process for those who had been waiting longest. For a major resort that surely knows its check-out patterns, this kind of bottleneck seems like poor planning, especially when your airport transfer service charges extra if guests aren't ready at the scheduled time."
"Regarding our beach access, our website does specify that we offer a rocky beach rather than a sandy one, which is typical for this part of Malta. We provide platforms and ladders for sea entry. I'm sorry if this wasn't what you expected. Did you try our designated swimming areas?","The issue isn't that it's rocky rather than sandy - I researched Malta enough to know that. The problem is that your marketing materials consistently use phrases like ""beachfront resort"" and ""private beach,"" creating an expectation of a proper beach area. What you actually offer are small concrete platforms scattered along a rocky shoreline, most barely large enough for a few loungers, with limited access points to the water. This isn't what most travelers would consider a ""beach"" by any definition. Several of these platforms were also closed for repairs during our stay, further limiting options. The photos on your website carefully frame these areas to make them appear more substantial than they are. More accurate descriptions would prevent this kind of expectation mismatch."
"I'm deeply concerned to hear about staff attitude problems during your stay. This does not reflect our service standards. Could you share which departments or specific interactions were problematic? We take this very seriously and want to address it with appropriate training.","The issues were primarily with front desk and pool bar staff. At the front desk, questions were often met with short, uninformative answers and a sense that we were being bothersome. For example, when asking about local transportation options, we were just handed a bus schedule without any explanation or recommendations. At the pool bar, staff would chat with each other while keeping guests waiting, and requests for service often required multiple attempts to get attention. What was particularly disappointing was the contrast - some staff (particularly in the breakfast area and housekeeping) were wonderful and engaging, which made the indifferent or dismissive attitudes elsewhere more noticeable. It seemed like a management or training issue rather than an individual problem, as it was consistent across certain departments."
"We apologize for the WiFi issues you experienced. We've recently upgraded our system, but there can still be some connection challenges in certain areas of the resort. Our IT team continuously works to improve coverage. Did you report these issues during your stay so we could have assisted?","Yes, I reported it three times during our 6-day stay. The first time, I was told to try reconnecting (which I had already done multiple times). The second time, they said they would ""reset something"" but nothing improved. The third time, I was told that WiFi can be ""inconsistent"" in some rooms and areas. The signal in our room would frequently drop altogether or become so slow it was unusable, especially in the evenings. This was particularly problematic as I needed to handle some work emails during our stay. For a business-oriented brand like Westin, reliable high-speed internet should be a basic requirement, not an occasional convenience. If there are known dead zones in the property, guests should be informed at check-in rather than discovering it through frustration."
"Thank you for your feedback about our fitness center. We understand the importance of up-to-date equipment for our wellness-focused guests. We're actually planning a renovation of the fitness center later this year with all new equipment. Was there anything specific you found lacking?","Most of the cardio machines were at least 7-8 years old with worn belts, faded displays, and missing function buttons. Two treadmills had ""out of order"" signs, and the weight machines had frayed cables and worn upholstery. Basic equipment like foam rollers and stretching mats were either missing or in poor condition. For a brand that emphasizes wellness and charges a premium rate, having a properly maintained fitness center should be a priority, not something planned for ""later this year."" I chose Westin partly because of the brand's wellness reputation, but this fitness center would be disappointing even in a mid-range hotel. Regular maintenance and periodic equipment replacement should be ongoing, not deferred until a complete renovation becomes absolutely necessary."
"I understand your concern about our resort fee. This fee covers several amenities including WiFi, fitness center access, pool towels, and certain recreational activities. We aim to be transparent about this fee, which is common in resort destinations. It should have been disclosed during the booking process.","The issue isn't the existence of the fee but the value received for it. When amenities covered by the resort fee aren't functioning properly (like the inconsistent WiFi) or are below standard (like the dated fitness center), it feels like paying extra for services that don't deliver as promised. Additionally, some items included in the fee, like pool towels, are standard inclusions at most hotels regardless of resort fees. The €25 daily charge added significantly to our stay cost, and I didn't see a corresponding €25/day value in the specific amenities it supposedly covered. If these are genuinely premium offerings worth an additional daily fee, they should be maintained to premium standards, not treated as afterthoughts."
"Thank you for pointing out the issues with our property signage. We aim to make navigation intuitive for all guests. Your feedback will help us identify areas where improved signage is needed. Were there specific areas where you found the directions particularly confusing?","The most confusing areas were finding the different pool areas from the main building, locating the restaurants (especially Quadro), and understanding which elevators went to which sections of the resort. The existing signs are small, sometimes blocked by plants, and don't provide clear directional indicators. We spent the first two days getting lost multiple times, and even on our last day, took a wrong turn trying to find the breakfast restaurant. Other guests we spoke with had similar experiences. For a resort of this size and layout, clear wayfinding is essential, especially for new arrivals. Even a simple property map in the room would help enormously, but ideally larger, more visible signs with clear directions would improve the guest experience significantly."
"I sincerely apologize for the errors with your reservation. This is definitely not the standard of service we aim to provide. Would you mind sharing the specific issues so we can address them in our systems and prevent similar problems for future guests?","Despite booking directly through your website and receiving confirmation, when we arrived, the system showed we had only booked for 3 nights instead of 5. I showed the confirmation email clearly showing 5 nights, but this still required 20 minutes at check-in to resolve while we waited with tired children. Then, although we had booked and paid for a sea-view room, we were initially assigned a garden-view room. When I questioned this, the front desk seemed reluctant to acknowledge the error until I again produced the confirmation details. These kinds of basic reservation errors create a poor first impression and start the stay on a stressful note. It's particularly frustrating when booking directly through your official channels (not a third party) and still encountering these problems."
"We apologize for the slow response to your maintenance request. Our standard is to address such issues within 30 minutes. It seems we fell short in this instance. Could you share what the issue was and how long it took to be resolved? We'll use this to improve our maintenance response procedures.","We reported a leaking air conditioning unit (that was dripping water onto the floor) on Monday morning around 9am. After no response by noon, we called again and were told maintenance was ""very busy."" Someone finally came to look at it around 4pm, said they needed a part, and left. No one returned that day. The next morning, we called again and were told they were ""still working on getting the part."" The repair was finally completed on Wednesday afternoon - more than 48 hours after our initial report. During this time, we had to keep towels on the floor to absorb the water and move our belongings to prevent damage. For a 5-star property, having to repeatedly follow up on a maintenance issue that was creating an actual hazard (slippery floor) and disruption is simply unacceptable."
"Thank you for letting us know about the balcony furniture issue. Our outdoor furniture is designed to withstand the Mediterranean elements, but we do replace items regularly. We'll have our maintenance team inspect the furniture in your room immediately. Was there a specific problem with it?","Yes, the chairs were severely rusted at the joints, with flakes of rust staining the balcony floor and transferring to clothing if you touched them. One chair was wobbly to the point of feeling unsafe. The small table was permanently stained and sticky, making it unusable for meals or drinks. We reported this on our second day, and someone did come to look, but just said they were ""like that due to sea air"" and no replacement was offered. For a sea-view room with a balcony that's prominently featured in your marketing as a place to relax, having unusable furniture significantly diminished the value of this feature. Basic maintenance like replacing badly rusted furniture should be routine, not something guests need to request."
"I'm very sorry that your initial complaint wasn't addressed satisfactorily. We aim to resolve guest concerns promptly and thoroughly. If you're willing, I'd appreciate understanding what happened with your original complaint and how we could have handled it better.","My initial complaint was about the strong sewage smell in our room, which I reported in person at the front desk on our second day. The staff member took notes but offered no immediate solution or acknowledgment of the problem. When nothing happened, I followed up the next day with a different staff member who claimed no record of my previous complaint existed. I then asked to speak with a manager, and was told one would call our room. No call came. On our fourth day, I approached a manager in the lobby, who apologized and offered to move us (though we'd already unpacked and established ourselves). What bothered me most was the lack of follow-through and communication - if my complaint was logged initially and taken seriously, I wouldn't have had to escalate multiple times, which took time away from our vacation."
"I apologize for the inaccuracies in your bill. This is certainly not acceptable, and we take billing errors very seriously. Our front office team reviews all charges before presenting final bills, so this represents a breakdown in our process. Could you elaborate on which charges were incorrect?","There were three specific issues: First, we were charged for two breakfasts on days when it was included in our rate - I had to show our booking confirmation to get these removed. Second, there were mini-bar charges for items we never consumed - when I questioned this, the staff member initially insisted they had been ""verified"" by housekeeping before reluctantly removing them. Third, and most concerning, there was a restaurant charge from a night when we weren't even dining at the hotel. When pointing this out, I was made to feel like I was being dishonest rather than the hotel having made an error. The entire check-out process took nearly 40 minutes due to these discrepancies, and the lack of immediate acknowledgment that mistakes had been made was frustrating. A simple apology and quick correction would have made a huge difference."
"We appreciate your feedback about our breakfast offerings. We pride ourselves on our breakfast selection, so I'm sorry to hear it didn't meet your expectations. Could you share more specific feedback about what aspects disappointed you? We're always looking to improve our culinary options.","The main issues were food quality and replenishment. Hot items like eggs and bacon sat under heat lamps for extended periods, becoming dry and overcooked. When trays emptied, they weren't promptly refilled - I waited 15 minutes one morning for the egg station to be restocked. Fresh fruit was limited to basic melon and pineapple, often not ripe. Pastries had clearly been frozen and thawed, lacking freshness you'd expect at a 5-star property. Coffee from the self-service machines was weak and often lukewarm. What was particularly disappointing was seeing the stark difference between the regular breakfast and what was served in the Executive Lounge - much higher quality and attention to detail there, suggesting you're capable of better quality but choose not to provide it in the main restaurant. For a hotel charging premium rates, breakfast should be a highlight, not just a box checked."
"I'm sorry you experienced issues with our in-room entertainment system. We've recently upgraded many of our rooms with new smart TVs and systems. Was your room equipped with the newer system, and what specific problems did you encounter?","Our room had what appeared to be a newer TV but with an outdated interface system. The specific issues included: channels frequently freezing and requiring a system restart, volume that would suddenly increase dramatically between channels, and an on-demand movie system that would buffer constantly making films unwatchable. We reported these issues twice, and technicians did visit, but said it was ""a system issue"" that couldn't be fixed in individual rooms. The TV remote was also worn with barely visible buttons and unresponsive controls. While TV might seem minor, when you're trying to relax in the evening or keep children entertained during downtime, these frustrations add up. Most mid-range hotels now offer seamless streaming options and reliable basic TV function - this felt like a system from 10+ years ago that hadn't been properly maintained."
"We apologize for the noise disturbance from neighboring rooms. Our building does have standard soundproofing, but we understand some noise can still be heard. If you ever experience this issue during a stay, please contact our front desk right away so we can address it or offer an alternative room if available.","I did report the noise issue after the first night, and was told that ""someone would speak to the neighbors."" The problem wasn't typical noise levels - it was that we could hear full conversations, TV shows, and even cell phone vibrations from adjacent rooms. This suggests a fundamental construction or insulation issue, not just particularly loud neighbors. When the noise continued the second night, I called again at 11:30pm and was told there were no other rooms available and that security would ""look into it."" No one ever followed up with us. For a hotel in this price category, proper soundproofing should be a basic expectation. It significantly impacted our sleep quality throughout the stay, which affected our daytime enjoyment. Being told to just report issues that aren't resolved doesn't actually solve the underlying problem."
"We take safety very seriously at our resort, so I'm concerned by your feedback. We have regular safety protocols and inspections in place throughout the property. Could you please share the specific safety concerns you noticed so we can address them immediately?","I noticed several concerning safety issues: First, the balcony railing in our room had a section where the bars were bent and widened enough that a child could potentially slip through - a serious fall hazard. Second, around the main pool, several tiles were loose and lifting, creating tripping hazards that I saw two guests stumble over. Third, the emergency exit sign near our room was unlit and difficult to see. I reported the balcony issue on our first day, and while someone did come to look, they simply said it ""met minimum requirements"" rather than fixing it. We ended up having to be hypervigilant with our children on the balcony. These aren't aesthetic issues but genuine safety concerns that should be identified and addressed through regular maintenance inspections, not left for guests to discover and report."
"I'm sorry your room view didn't meet expectations, especially after receiving an upgrade. Our sea-view categories vary somewhat in their positioning and angle of water visibility. For your next stay, we can note your preference for a direct, unobstructed view. May I ask which room category you were originally booked in and what you were upgraded to?","We originally booked a Deluxe Sea View room and were ""upgraded"" to a Premium Sea View room. The issue wasn't about the angle or partiality of the view - it was that despite the ""premium"" designation, our view was predominantly of the building's roof and mechanical equipment, with only a narrow glimpse of water visible from one corner of the balcony. When I inquired about this, I was told that technically any room with even a minimal sea view qualifies as a ""sea view"" room regardless of what else is in the sightline. This feels like a technicality rather than an honest description. An upgrade should enhance the experience, not just change the room category in name while providing a less desirable outlook. It was particularly disappointing because we specifically chose this hotel for the promised sea views."
"I apologize for the inconvenience with pool towel availability. We try to ensure adequate towel supply throughout the day. During peak season, there can be higher demand periods. We'll review our towel service procedures to prevent shortages. Did you experience this issue on multiple occasions?","Yes, this happened three different days during our stay, always between 2-4pm. The towel hut would completely run out of towels, and the attendant would simply say ""more coming soon"" without any estimate of when. One day we waited over 45 minutes for fresh towels to arrive. What made it particularly frustrating was watching guests ""reserve"" multiple loungers by taking 3-4 towels each early in the morning, while actual swimmers couldn't get a single dry towel in the afternoon. There seemed to be no system for managing fair distribution or ensuring consistent availability. When paying a resort fee that specifically includes ""pool towel service,"" I expect that service to be reliable throughout operating hours, not subject to unpredictable shortages that force guests to sit wet or use their bathroom towels at the pool."
"I understand your frustration with the early check-in situation. While we always try to accommodate early arrivals when possible, room availability depends on previous guests' departures and our housekeeping schedule. We do offer luggage storage and use of facilities while waiting. May I ask if these options were offered to you?","The issue wasn't that my room wasn't ready early - I understand that's subject to availability. The problem was the handling of my request. I had emailed a week before arrival asking about early check-in possibilities since our flight arrived at 9am. The response promised to ""make a note of your early arrival"" and ""prioritize your room."" When we arrived at 10:30am, the front desk had no record of this request and claimed they never received any communication about it. I showed the email on my phone, and the staff member simply shrugged and said ""sometimes those requests don't get entered in our system."" We were told rooms would be ready ""after 3pm"" with no priority given despite the promise. What's frustrating isn't the policy but the broken promise and lack of accountability for the miscommunication. Better to say ""we can't guarantee anything"" than to make promises that aren't kept."
"I apologize for the issues with our shuttle service. We aim to provide reliable transportation on the published schedule. Would you be willing to share what specific problems you encountered so we can improve this service?","There were several issues with the shuttle service. First, the published schedule showed hourly departures to St. Julian's, but when we tried to use it on Tuesday, we were told it only runs ""on certain days"" - information not mentioned anywhere in your materials. Second, when we did use it on Thursday, the shuttle was 25 minutes late with no explanation or apology from the driver. Third, for the return pickup, we were at the designated spot at the scheduled time, but the shuttle never arrived. After waiting 30 minutes, we called the hotel and were told the driver had been there but left because ""no one was waiting"" - even though we were exactly where directed at the proper time. We ended up having to pay €25 for a taxi back. A hotel shuttle service should be reliable and consistent, with clear communication about any schedule limitations, otherwise it's not a usable amenity."
"I'm truly sorry that your special occasion wasn't recognized during your stay. We pride ourselves on creating memorable experiences, especially for celebrations. We do have protocols to flag special occasions noted during booking. Would you mind sharing what occasion you were celebrating and how it was communicated to us?","We were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary, which I noted both in the original booking form and in a follow-up email sent two weeks before arrival. I received a response to that email saying ""we've noted your special occasion and will ensure it's recognized during your stay."" Despite these multiple notifications, there was absolutely no acknowledgment - not a verbal congratulation at check-in, not a note in the room, nothing. What made it more disappointing was overhearing another couple at breakfast being congratulated on their anniversary and presented with a complimentary champagne toast. This suggested that you do have a system for recognizing special occasions, but it failed in our case. These personal touches matter enormously for special trips, and the complete oversight made us feel like just another booking rather than valued guests celebrating a significant milestone."
"I'm sorry our concierge recommendations didn't meet your expectations. Our team aims to provide suggestions tailored to each guest's preferences. Could you share more about what you asked for and what was recommended that you found disappointing?","I asked for recommendations for authentic local restaurants away from tourist areas, emphasizing that we wanted genuine Maltese cuisine and were willing to travel to find it. The concierge immediately handed us a pre-printed sheet with what were clearly tourist-focused restaurants, all within walking distance of the hotel. When I asked again about more authentic options, he recommended a restaurant that turned out to be an international chain. When we later spoke with our taxi driver about our experience, he laughed and listed several fantastic local places just a short drive away that the concierge had never mentioned. It felt like the recommendations were based on convenience or possibly business relationships rather than quality or authenticity. A good concierge service, especially at a luxury property, should offer insider knowledge beyond what travelers could find themselves in a guidebook or quick internet search."
"I apologize for the confusion regarding your resort credit. These credits should be easily accessible and clearly explained at check-in. Can you tell me more about what happened when you tried to use yours? This will help us improve our process.","The resort credit was part of our booking package (€100 credit for our 5-night stay), but when we tried to use it for a dinner at Quadro on our third night, the server said there was no record of any credit on our account. We had to return to reception, where after 15 minutes of checking, they acknowledged the credit but said it needed to be ""activated"" - something that should have been done at check-in but wasn't. Then, when checking out, we discovered that the credit could only be used in increments exactly matching our charges - so when our final dinner was €82, we lost €18 of the credit as it couldn't be partially applied. These restrictions weren't explained anywhere, and the front desk person simply said ""that's just how our system works."" If a resort credit has specific usage limitations or requires activation, this should be clearly communicated upfront, not discovered through frustrated attempts to use it."
"We appreciate your feedback about our pricing structure. We aim to provide value along with premium services. Could you share which specific charges you found excessive? This helps us evaluate our pricing compared to guest expectations and local standards.","Several charges stood out as excessive: €8 for a small bottle of water from the mini-bar (the same brand available for €1 in local shops), €6.50 for a single espresso at the lobby bar, €35 daily parking fee despite the hotel having ample parking space, and a €20 charge to use a pool umbrella. These fees felt like deliberate nickel-and-diming after already paying a premium room rate plus resort fee. The water was particularly frustrating as the tap water isn't recommended for drinking, making bottled water essentially a necessity, not a luxury. Other resorts I've stayed at in similar price categories provide complimentary bottled water daily and free use of pool amenities once you've paid the resort fee. When every basic comfort comes with an additional charge, it creates a constant feeling of being taken advantage of rather than being a valued guest."
"Thank you for mentioning the lack of post-stay follow-up. We typically send a satisfaction survey after each stay, so I'm concerned yours may have been missed. We value guest feedback and use it to make improvements. Would you have been more satisfied if we had reached out to address your concerns after your departure?","Yes, absolutely. After experiencing multiple issues during our stay, I expected some form of follow-up survey or email asking about our experience. When nothing came (I checked junk folders too), it reinforced the impression that the hotel wasn't particularly concerned about guest satisfaction or improving problem areas. What's especially disappointing is that no one from management ever responded to the written feedback I left at checkout detailing our main concerns. This lack of acknowledgment suggests feedback isn't really valued, despite claims to the contrary. A simple email acknowledging my comments or explaining steps to address issues would have significantly improved my final impression of the resort. Instead, it felt like our experience was forgotten the moment we walked out the door, which doesn't inspire confidence for future stays or recommendations."
