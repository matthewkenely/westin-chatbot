The smell from the bathroom drain in our room was unbearable. How can you charge €300+ per night for rooms with such issues?
I couldn't sleep for three nights because of the noisy air conditioning unit. It kept rattling and humming constantly.
The temperature control in our room didn't work properly - we could only get heat despite it being 25°C outside.
Our room was right next to the children's playground. The noise was constant and made relaxing impossible.
I'm extremely disappointed that your "suite" doesn't actually have separate rooms. This is misleading advertising.
The housekeeping service was inconsistent during our stay. Some days the room was barely touched.
For a supposedly 5-star hotel, your rooms are noticeably outdated with visible wear and tear.
We found yesterday's room service trays still in our room when we returned in the evening. This level of negligence is unacceptable.
We waited almost an hour for the baby cot we requested months in advance. This is no way to treat guests with infants.
Room service took over 75 minutes to deliver a simple dessert order, which arrived cold.
As a Gold member, I found the check-in experience unwelcoming and disappointing. No recognition of status whatsoever.
The main swimming pool is just a large rectangle of water with no interesting features. Not what I expect from a 5-star resort.
Your website prominently features the casino, but it's tiny - just a few slot machines and two tables in what looks like a converted meeting room.
The elevator situation was terrible - two out of four were broken for our entire stay, causing long waits and crowded lifts.
The Executive Lounge happy hour selection was extremely limited compared to other Marriott properties I've visited.
The whirlpool was ice cold throughout our stay. What's the point of having a cold whirlpool?
My massage at the spa was one of the worst I've had - the therapist seemed untrained and the massage table was uncomfortable.
We were turned away from the Executive Lounge at 6pm because we had our 8-year-old with us. This policy was never disclosed when we purchased lounge access.
Instant coffee packets in the room? Really? Other hotels in this price range offer proper coffee machines.
As someone with celiac disease, I found your gluten-free breakfast options not only limited but potentially dangerous due to cross-contamination.
When I asked about plain protein options in the Executive Lounge due to dietary restrictions, I was rudely told "what you see is what we have."
Two of your four restaurants were closed during our stay, which wasn't mentioned anywhere when we booked.
Why can't I order food at 3pm at the pool bar? There's a strange 2-3 hour window where getting food anywhere in the resort is unnecessarily difficult.
I'm on a training diet (high-protein, low-carb) and found almost nothing suitable on your menus.
The overall value for money at this resort is poor. When paying €350+ per night, I expect far better maintenance, service, and amenities.
The check-out process took nearly 35 minutes, with only two staff members handling a long line of guests.
Your marketing materials call this a "beachfront resort" with a "private beach," but it's just small concrete platforms on rocks.
Some of your staff, particularly at the front desk and pool bar, were dismissive and seemed annoyed when asked questions.
The WiFi was consistently unreliable in our room, dropping connection frequently or becoming unusably slow.
The fitness center equipment is outdated and poorly maintained - several machines had "out of order" signs.
The daily resort fee of €25 doesn't seem to provide €25 worth of value, especially when the included amenities don't work properly.
The property signage is inadequate - we got lost multiple times trying to find different areas of the resort.
There were multiple errors with our reservation despite booking directly through your website.
It took over 48 hours to fix our leaking air conditioning unit after multiple calls to maintenance.
The balcony furniture in our sea-view room was severely rusted and unusable - one chair felt unsafe to sit on.
I reported the sewage smell issue multiple times, but nothing was done and no manager ever called as promised.
Our final bill had multiple incorrect charges, and the staff made me feel like I was being dishonest when I pointed them out.
The breakfast buffet quality was disappointing - hot items were overcooked, trays weren't promptly refilled, and the coffee was lukewarm.
The TV system in our room constantly froze and buffered, making it unusable for evening entertainment.
We could hear full conversations from neighboring rooms - the soundproofing in this hotel is practically non-existent.
I noticed several safety concerns, including loose pool tiles and a balcony railing with gaps wide enough for a child to slip through.
Our "upgraded" Premium Sea View room mostly overlooked mechanical equipment on the roof, with only a tiny glimpse of water.
The pool towel service ran out of towels multiple afternoons, leaving swimmers to sit wet or use bathroom towels.
Despite emailing about early check-in a week in advance and receiving confirmation, the front desk had no record of our request when we arrived.
The hotel shuttle service was unreliable - it didn't follow the published schedule and left us stranded in town.
Our 15th wedding anniversary was completely ignored despite noting it during booking and in a follow-up email.
The concierge only recommended tourist trap restaurants despite our request for authentic local places.
The €100 resort credit included in our package wasn't properly activated and had restrictions that weren't disclosed.
The pricing for basic amenities was excessive - €8 for a small bottle of water and €20 to use a pool umbrella?
I left detailed feedback at checkout about our disappointments, but never received any follow-up or acknowledgment from management.
